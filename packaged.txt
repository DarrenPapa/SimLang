If you are really insterested in paclaged functions.
Here you go.

Example use of packaged functions.
== Test.sl.txt
pack test, name // Packaged functions work like separate scripts
  println %name
end:pack:test

pack:test "Name Here" // They are called similarly to functions but
// with the "pack:" prefix.
== end of Test.sl.txt

They can be imported into scripts!
You can use `run_file "script_here.sl.txt"` to import them.

ANY DATA LOSS IS NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY, YOU WERE WARNED THAT PACKAGED
FUNCTIONS ARE NOT SAFELY IMPLEMENTED YET.
