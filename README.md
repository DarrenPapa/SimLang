Yey another programming language :)

It's a simple programming language, but its very confusing to write in.
The only mutable data type is a dictionary (pass-by-value)

It supports the following data types:
- Strings
- Integers
- Floats
- Lists
- Dictionaries

For more details look at the `docu.txt` file or check out `read.txt` for
details about the files.
